# Frontmend Framework

A bare bones front-end framework, with RequireJS, google analytics, typekit, retina.js and modernizr.

## To-do

- HTML is boring and verbose; implement index and 404 using jade.
- Flesh out the mixins .scss file with my most used and common mixins.
- Do some profiling to validate the current JavaScript structure.
- See what can be done at this stage to ease the introduction of JavaScript testing.
