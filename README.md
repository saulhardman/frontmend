# Frontmend Framework

A bare bones front-end framework, with RequireJS, bower, and grunt.

## My Flow

`cd yourRepoName`
`ln -s pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit`
`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

`sudo npm install -g bower`

## To-do

- Flesh out the mixins .scss file with my most used and common mixins.
- See what can be done at this stage to ease the introduction of JavaScript testing.
- bring in dependencies using [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/)
- create a node package using npm (like [heisenburg.js](https://github.com/Heisenbergjs/heisenberg-npm))
